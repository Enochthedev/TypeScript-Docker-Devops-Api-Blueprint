# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This CI/CD pipeline is structured into distinct stages, each encapsulated within dedicated YAML files. The pipeline is designed to facilitate the continuous integration and deployment processes, ensuring code quality, security, and performance considerations are addressed throughout.

### 1. **Code Review, Quality, and Security (reviewer.yml)**

   - **codeReview:** Initiates code review processes.
   - **codeQuality:** Executes static code analysis and enforces coding standards.
   - **security:** Performs security scans and vulnerability checks.
   - **unitTest:** Executes unit tests for code components.
   - **requiresApproval:** A stage requiring manual approval before progressing further.

### 2. **Build and Testing (build.yml)**

   - **unitTest:** Re-Executes unit tests for code components.
   - **codeCoverage:** Measures code coverage.
   - **codeQuality:** Re-evaluates code quality to ensure consistency.
   - **security:** Conducts security scans.

### 3. **Integration, End-to-End, and Performance Testing (test.yml)**

   - **integrationTest:** Runs integration tests.
   - **e2eTest:** Executes end-to-end tests.
   - **BusinessLogicTest:** Conducts specific tests related to business logic.
   - **PerformanceTest:** Evaluates the system's performance under various scenarios.
   - **DependencyCheck:** Scans for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

### 4. **Pre-Production Deployment (PreProd.yml)**

   - **Deploy:** Deploys the application to a pre-production environment.
   - **SmokeTest:** Verifies basic functionality in the pre-production environment.
   - **Security:** Performs additional security checks.
   - **PerformanceTest:** Conducts performance tests in the pre-production environment.

### 5. **Production Testing (ProdTestersBox.yml)**

   - **Deploy:** Initiates the deployment to the production testing environment.
   - **SmokeTest:** Validates essential functionalities in the production testing environment.
   - **Security:** Performs comprehensive security checks.
   - **PerformanceTest:** Conducts thorough performance testing.
   - **BakePeriod:** Allows time for the release to stabilize.
   - **Rollback Alarms:** Monitors for potential issues that might warrant a rollback.
   - **Canary:** Deploys the release gradually to a subset of users for early detection of issues.
   - **RequiresApproval:** A stage requiring manual approval before proceeding.

### 6. **Production Deployment (Prod.yml)**

   - **deploy:** Initiates the deployment to the production environment.
   - **smokeTest:** Verifies essential functionalities in the production environment.
   - **security:** Performs final security checks.
   - **performanceTest:** Conducts a final round of performance testing.
   - **requiresApproval:** A stage requiring manual approval before completing the deployment.

## Usage

1. Ensure proper configuration in each YAML file.
2. Trigger the pipeline manually or through automated triggers based on version control events.
3. Monitor the pipeline stages for successful execution or potential issues.
4. Refer to specific logs and reports generated during each stage for detailed information.
5. For manual approval stages, follow the provided instructions for approval.

This CI/CD pipeline is designed to streamline the software development lifecycle, from code integration to production deployment, with a focus on maintaining high standards of code quality, security, and performance.
